PROJECT TITLE - MAZE SOLVER

In this file I am going to explain , what input we have to take for
correct output.

When we run the code , first it will ask for num of rows . since it work on square matrix .
so the num of rows = num of columns too.

INPUT EXAMPLE 1. 

Step1:- Suppose we enter - 4 as num of rows so the matrix . So 4 * 4 matrix will form .

Step2:- Now it will ask for 1 row value :
  1 0 0 1

Step3:- Now row 2 value:
  1 1 0 0

Step4:- Now row 3 value:
  0 1 1 0

Step5:- Now Row 4 value:
  0 0 1 1

In the maze matrix, 0 means the block is a dead end and 1 means the
block can be used in the path from source to destination. 

INPUT EXAMPLE 2.

step1:- It will ask for num of rows :
5 

Step2:- Now it will ask for 1 row value:
